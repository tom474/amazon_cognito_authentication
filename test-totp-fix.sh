echo "=============================="
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ Changes Made:"
echo "1. Updated setupTOTP() to accept totpSetupDetails from sign-in flow"
echo "2. Modified confirmTOTPSetup() to use confirmSignIn during sign-in"
echo "3. Fixed signin page to pass totpSetupDetails from nextStep"
echo "4. Added duringSignIn prop to TOTPSetup component"
echo ""

echo "üéØ How It Should Work Now:"
echo "1. User enters email/password ‚Üí Signs in"
echo "2. Cognito returns CONTINUE_SIGN_IN_WITH_TOTP_SETUP"
echo "3. App uses nextStep.totpSetupDetails (no separate API call needed)"
echo "4. QR code displayed using the setup details"
echo "5. User scans QR code and enters TOTP code"
echo "6. App calls confirmSignIn() with the TOTP code"
echo "7. Sign-in completes successfully"
echo ""

echo "üß™ Test Instructions:"
echo "1. Open: http://localhost:3000/auth/signin"
echo "2. Enter email/password for user WITHOUT TOTP setup"
echo "3. Should immediately see QR code page (no authentication error)"
echo "4. Scan QR code or use manual entry"
echo "5. Enter 6-digit code from authenticator app"
echo "6. Should successfully complete sign-in"
echo ""

echo "üö® Expected Fix:"
echo "‚Ä¢ No more 'UserUnAuthenticatedException' error"
echo "‚Ä¢ QR code appears immediately after credentials"
echo "‚Ä¢ TOTP verification works correctly"
echo "‚Ä¢ User gets signed in after TOTP setup"
echo ""

echo "üîç Debug Information:"
echo "Browser Console should show:"
echo "‚Ä¢ 'Using TOTP setup details from sign-in flow'"
echo "‚Ä¢ 'TOTP setup confirmed during sign-in'"
echo "‚Ä¢ No authentication errors"
