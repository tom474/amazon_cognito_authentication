# TOTP QR Code Setup & Email Reset Testing Guide

## üéØ Overview

This guide covers testing the two main fixes implemented:

1. **TOTP QR Code Setup**: After entering email/password, users are prompted to scan a QR code with their authenticator app
2. **Email-based Reset**: Password reset codes are sent via email instead of SMS

---

## üîß Fixed Issues

### Issue 1: TOTP Setup Not Triggering

**Problem**: After signing in, users weren't seeing the QR code setup page
**Solution**: Added proper detection for `CONTINUE_SIGN_IN_WITH_TOTP_SETUP` in the sign-in flow

### Issue 2: SMS Instead of Email for Reset

**Problem**: Password reset codes were being sent via SMS
**Solution**: Configured reset password to use email delivery method
